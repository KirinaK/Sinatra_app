    <p>Well, well, well, <%= login %>!</p>
    <p>
      <% if email %>
        It looks like your public email address is <%= email %>.
        <a href='/logout'>Logout</a>
      <% else %>
        It looks like you don't have a public email. That's cool.
      <% end %>

      <% if private_emails %>
        With your permission, we were also able to dig up your private email addresses:
        <%= private_emails.map{ |private_email_address| private_email_address["email"] }.join(', ') %>
        <br>
        <a href='/logout'>Logout</a>
        <a href='/show_users'>Show Users</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/<%= current_user_id %>" target='_blank'>Current user</a>
      <% else %>
        Also, you're a bit secretive about your private email addresses.
